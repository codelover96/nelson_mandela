        <h4>Some notable quotes by Nelson Mandela :</h4>
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li><p><em>It always seems impossible until it's done.</em></p></li>
        <li><p><em>Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.</em></p></li>
        <li><p><em>It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory
          when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your
          leadership.</em></p></li>
